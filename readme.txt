This is the readme for the model associated with the book chapter:

Development of a Computational Approach/Model to Explore NMDA Receptors Functions (2017)

These files model the response of an NMDA receptor kinetic model to a 1ms pulse of glutamate (8 microM) as a function of magnesium concentration.

Content of the zip file: 3 files including this readme.

One file is the NMDA model (XML file). 
The other is python scripts used to run the simulation and plot the results. The results plotted correspond to figure 3 of the paper.

Requirements:  Libroadrunner (free open source simulation engine), Python, Numpy and MatplotLib.

To run:  
In a terminal, type:    python KELLER_Book_Chapter_figure3_NMDA_fct_Mg.py

Result corresponding to Fig. 3 of the book chapter will appear in the folder 
after successful run (name: NMDA-R Current (pA)_all_Mg_concentrations.pdf)
